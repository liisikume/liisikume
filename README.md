ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @liisikume
ðŸŒ± A learning fan, a recent graduate of Python from Scratch course, and eager to get more hands-on IT experience.

Have a look at my projects:
- Here is an [animal encyclopedia](https://github.com/liisikume/animal-encyclopedia) website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
  
- After being provided with a task to create a password generator, I developed an [application](https://github.com/liisikume/password-generator) in Python for generating easily remembered passwords
  
- I have also created a [Book of Quotes](https://github.com/liisikume/book-of-quotes) application for entering, storing, searching, and editing quotes along with their authors that can be modified to store a variety of information that can be categorized
